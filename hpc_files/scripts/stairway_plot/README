### README FOR STAIRWAY PLOT 2 ANALYSES ###
###########################################

### DIRECTIONS ###
These four scripts were used to run Stairway Plot 2 analyses. From a 1D folded SFS in fastsimcoal2 format,
parse_sfs.R and create_blueprint.sh are used to create the blueprint file used to launch Stairway Plot,
launch_stairway.sh wraps the input file creation and Stairway Plot running into one script, and top_level_run_stairway.sh
launches the launch_stairway.sh script to run Stairway Plot on all the datasets (north region polyodon, mid region
polyodon, north region kazumbe, mid region kazumbe) all at once.


### SCRIPT DETAILS ###
- create_blueprint.sh
  info: creates the blueprint file for running Stairway Plot 2
- launch_stairway.sh
  info: script that wraps parse_sfs.R and create_blueprint.sh to create the input file for Stairway
        Plot 2 and then launches the Stairway Plot run.
- parse_sfs.R
  info: process sfs file (in fastsimcoal2 format) to feed into the create_blueprint.sh script
- top_level_run_stairway.sh
  info: the "top level" script that is used to launch the Stairway Plot analyses. It moves the SFS files
        into a directory, copies the names of the SFS into a file (used for SLURM array in launch_stairway.sh),
        and then launches launch_stairway.sh to perform Stairway Plot analyses.
